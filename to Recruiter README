## To prepare this project I used a create-react-app

- Webpack is already built-in into c-r-a.
    You can find its config file in node_modules/react-scripts.

- SASS
    In my opinion it's not necessary to use CSS Preprocessor if we use react.
    However, with reference to sub-task I add and configured SASS.

 //TODO add a description if I will respond to another sub-tasks
