## To prepare this project I used a Create-React-App

 # I configured a whole project in way to run all what You need by only typing a "npm start".
    So please type "npm install" and "npm start".
    I didn't create backend autostart for build part. 

- Webpack, Express are already built-in into C-R-A.
    You can find webpack config file in node_modules/react-scripts.
    To avoid conflicts I didn't doubled them (Webpack, Express). In consequence Webstorm or any similar may not mark connections to Express.
    EDIT: I decided to install express and add it to package.json. Just because the highlights are really helpful.

- Express app.listen(3300)

- SASS
    In my opinion it's not necessary to use CSS Preprocessor if we use react.
    However, with reference to sub-task I add and configured SASS.

 //TODO I should add a description if I will respond to another sub-tasks
