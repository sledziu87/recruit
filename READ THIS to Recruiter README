## To prepare this project I used a create-react-app

 # I configured a whole project in way to run all what You need by only typing a "npm start".
    So please type "npm install" and "npm start".
    I didn't create node autostart for build part.

- Webpack, Express are already built-in into c-r-a.
    You can find webpack config file in node_modules/react-scripts.

- Express app.listen(3300)

- SASS
    In my opinion it's not necessary to use CSS Preprocessor if we use react.
    However, with reference to sub-task I add and configured SASS.

 //TODO I should add a description if I will respond to another sub-tasks
